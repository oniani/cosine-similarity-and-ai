% Example Section
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Choosing the right metric~\cite{thomas_uminsky} can be crucial to designing
performant artificial intelligence models. Thousands of packages and libraries
have been built and written just for providing these metrics. Cosine similarity
is one of many metrics used extensively in natural language processing and
artificial intelligence tasks.  The paper will introduce the technique and
discuss its advantages and disadvantages as well as compare it to other
approaches. Additionally, sample implementations of the above-mentioned
approaches might also be provided.
